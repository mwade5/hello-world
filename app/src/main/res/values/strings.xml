<!-- Purpose: strings.xml helps with something in Android called "Localization". More specifically, the Android system selects
              which resource to use (default or alternate) based on the location of the device. strings.xml makes sure the proper
              strings are loaded in based on the device's locale.
     Modifications:
        1. Added two new strings 'Enter a message' and 'Send'. -->
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">Hello World</string>
    <string name="edit_message">Enter a message</string>
    <string name="button_send">Send</string>
</resources>
